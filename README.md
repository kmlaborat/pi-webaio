# pi-webaio

All-in-one web access tools for [pi](https://pi.dev): search, fetch, crawl,
extract, map, cache, chunk, and render web content for AI agents.

## Fork Note

This repository is a fork of
[apmantza/pi-webaio](https://github.com/apmantza/pi-webaio). It exists to
carry one local fix and is not a divergence in scope.

### The bug

Searching or fetching results containing long CJK or other wide-character
text could crash the pi TUI with:

```text
Rendered line 0 exceeds terminal width (65 > 60).
```

pi-tui enforces a hard invariant: every line a component renders must fit
the requested terminal width, and it throws when a line does not.

### Root cause

The fallback TUI renderers measured that width with JavaScript's
`String.length`, which counts UTF-16 code units. For CJK and other wide
characters a single character is one code unit but occupies two terminal
columns, so `String.length` is not the display width:

```text
input:  aio-webfetch https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/日本語のページタイトル
        String.length       = 54
        display columns     = 65
        terminal width      = 60

        54 > 60  →  false  →  no truncation performed
                         →  a 65-column line is handed to pi-tui
                         →  pi-tui throws
```

The guard passed, so the text was never truncated at all. This surfaced on
the first tool call of a session because `renderCall` runs through the lazy
fallback path before the full runtime renderer is loaded.

### The fix

A dependency-free display-column helper was added at
`src/display-width.ts`:

- `displayWidth(text)` — estimated terminal display width in columns
- `truncateToDisplayWidth(text, width, ellipsis?)` — truncate to a column
  budget

The two fallback renderers that returned raw `string[]` — `fallbackComponent`
in `src/tools/lazy.ts` and `FallbackText.render` in `src/tools/tui-compat.ts`
— now truncate with that helper instead of `.length`. The invariant the fix
establishes is:

```text
displayWidth(truncateToDisplayWidth(s, width)) <= width
```

The fix corrects the measurement unit. It does not catch or swallow the
exception; the fallback renderer itself now satisfies the width invariant
before any line reaches pi-tui.

The helper is a **safe, conservative estimate**, not a complete Unicode
width implementation, and it is deliberately not claimed to match
`pi-tui`'s `visibleWidth()` exactly. Known differences all err wide, which
is the safe direction (`displayWidth(s) >= visibleWidth(s)`): combining
marks count as one column, ZWJ emoji clusters are counted as the sum of
their parts, and narrow scripts above U+2E80 count as two columns.
Over-truncation is cosmetic; under-counting crashes the host.

### Scope

The change is limited to the fallback rendering paths that could emit an
over-width line. Every other `render()` in the codebase delegates to
`Text` or `Markdown`, which wrap, so those paths cannot overflow and were
left alone.

This fork deliberately does **not** undertake a general Unicode migration of
`.length` or `.slice()` usage. Those sites may still have CJK display-quality
issues; they are cosmetic, not crash-causing, and are out of scope here.

### Upstream relationship

This fix is maintained locally and is not intended as a pull request. It is
documented here so that the diff — what was broken, why it was broken, and
what was changed — is legible to anyone reading it later, including
upstream.


## What It Does

pi-webaio registers eight pi tools:

- `aio-websearch` — search DuckDuckGo, Brave, Yahoo, Bing, **TinyFish**, **FireCrawl Keyless**, and **Parallel** in parallel, with default Google (via a local CDP broker) and an opt-in Reddit CDP companion (`reddit: true`, requires Chrome). Returns in ~2.9s with live per-provider TUI progress (spinner rows, result counts with latency, an elapsed-vs-target bar) and a stable final view showing every engine's count and timing
- `aio-webfetch` — fetch one or many URLs into markdown or structured formats, with an opt-in heading outline, query-focused answer mode, and multi-source cited answers
- `aio-webcontent` — retrieve cached content by URL (with opt-in section-level diff)
- `aio-webresult` — retrieve cached results by response ID
- `aio-webmap` — discover site pages or map GitHub repositories without fetching
- `aio-webpull` — crawl/pull sites into local markdown files
- `aio-webquery` — BM25 search over a locally-pulled corpus (offline, no re-fetching)
- `aio-webresearch` — single-round research bundle: search → rank → fetch → cited evidence bundle on disk

It includes anti-bot TLS fingerprinting, browser fallback, 21 API-first
extractors (GitHub, YouTube, npm/PyPI and other package registries, Context7,
DeepWiki, and more), RAG chunking, TUI progress rendering, phase-aware errors,
opt-in paywall bypass support, and **keyless providers** (FireCrawl) and **API-key providers** (TinyFish, Parallel) that work
without API keys.

### Extra Providers

**FireCrawl Keyless** (free, 1k credits/month, **no API key needed**):

- Search: works out of the box as a search provider
- Fetch: `firecrawl: true` on `aio-webfetch` — delegates to FireCrawl Scrape API

**TinyFish** (free, requires API key in `~/.piwebaio/config` or `~/.piwebaio/.env`):

- Search: unlimited free search results
- Fetch: `tinyfish: true` on `aio-webfetch` — delegates to TinyFish Fetch API

Both providers run in parallel with the HTTP engines during search.
For fetch, the recommended chain is FireCrawl → TinyFish → normal pipeline.

Google Search uses the local CDP broker by default (faster cold start, tighter
p95, 100% Google success under concurrency — see `speed.md`). Google ignores the
deprecated `num` param and renders ~8–10 organic results per SERP page, so the
broker **paginates through `?start=10`, `?start=20`, …** (the same mechanism
Google's own "Next" links use), merging and URL-deduping pages up to `max` until
the lane is satisfied, the SERP runs out of new organics, or the lane budget is
exhausted. The Google lane carries a hard 3-second cap measured from when its
search starts, so it never gates the tool's 7-second overall deadline — even on
a full multi-page pagination. If a page-2+ navigation or extraction fails, the
lane degrades gracefully to the results it had already collected and annotates
`googleStatus` accordingly (e.g. `ok (an extra SERP page failed…)`); a total
fresh failure still surfaces as an error. Set `PI_WEBAIO_CDP_BROKER=0` to force
the legacy extractor.
The manual, live-only benchmark is `npm run bench:google-cdp -- --live
--query "..." --samples 3`. It reports total/startup measurements; detailed CDP
phase timings are not yet instrumented, and no speedup is inferred.

For the **full public tool path** (HTTP engines + Google + Reddit under the
response target), use `scripts/bench-full-search.mjs`:

```bash
node --experimental-strip-types scripts/bench-full-search.mjs broker 10 3000 "query"
```

`<legacy|broker>` picks the Google path; sample 1 measures cold start and
samples 2–n are warm; the third argument is inter-sample spacing in ms. On the
2.9s response-target path the tool returns at the budget by design — recent
runs: p50 ≈ 2.90s both modes, HTTP success 10/10 (see `speed.md` for full
tables and environment caveats).

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-webaio
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/apmantza/pi-webaio
```

## Static Fetch API

Use `pi-webaio/webfetch` when an integration needs local extraction without
registering the eight `aio-*` tools:

```js
import { fetch } from "pi-webaio/webfetch";

const abortController = new AbortController();
const result = await fetch("https://example.com/article", {
  format: "markdown",
  maxChars: 50_000,
  signal: abortController.signal,
});

if (!result.ok) throw new Error(`${result.error.code}: ${result.error.message}`);
console.log(result.content);
```

The entrypoint uses `wreq-js` TLS fingerprinting and local Defuddle extraction.
It does not start a browser, call a remote reader, register pi tools, or write a
content cache. HTTP and literal client-side redirects are followed manually.
For direct requests, each destination is checked by the public-network guard
and pinned into the `wreq-js` transport before connection. Cross-origin
redirects retain only `Accept`, `Accept-Language`, and `User-Agent` from the
request headers.

The default call budget is 15 seconds, including bounded cleanup. The call can
download up to 10 MiB across all retry attempts and redirect responses, then
return up to 50,000 characters. It follows at most ten redirects and retries a
failed hop at most twice. The input cap cannot exceed 10 MiB.

Header names and values are validated before a request. Transport-controlled
framing headers such as `Host` and `Content-Length` are rejected.

### Errors

A failed call returns `{ ok: false, error }` rather than throwing. The error
uses pi-webaio's single shared taxonomy — the same `FetchErrorCode`,
`FetchPhase`, and `FetchErrorCategory` the `aio-*` tools and the MCP server
report — so one `switch` over codes works on every surface:

```js
if (!result.ok) {
  const { code, phase, category, retryable, statusCode } = result.error;
  // e.g. "parse_error" / "processing" / "processing" / false
}
```

`retryable` defaults from the shared retry matrix, so it means "a later call
may succeed" — not "this call will be retried" (retries within a single call
are governed by `maxRetries`). Corrupt or undecodable content reports
`parse_error` at phase `processing` and is never marked retryable.

`format` accepts `markdown`, `html`, `text`, `json`, or `raw`. `html` requires
an HTML response and returns Defuddle's cleaned HTML. `json` requires a JSON
response and returns pretty-printed JSON text. `text` removes markup from HTML
and XML. `raw` returns the decoded textual response before extraction; binary
responses are rejected. HTML extraction accepts `removeImages` and
`includeReplies`.

A configured proxy is checked and pinned before connection. HTTP(S) forward
proxies and `socks5h` proxies can resolve the target independently, so target
pinning cannot be enforced through those modes. Use them only with a proxy
whose destination policy you trust. Successful results report
`targetPinning: "proxy-dependent"` when a proxy is configured.
